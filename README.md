# 📊 EIC Financial Analysis (2014–2018)

## 🚀 Overview  
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize Electric Insurance Company’s financials from 2014 to 2018. This project uncovered how persistent underwriting losses and delayed strategic actions led to the company’s collapse despite a return to profitability in 2018.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

- **Power BI** – Dynamic dashboards, drill-through reports, multi-year financial trends

- **Financial Analysis** – Profitability metrics, year-over-year trend analysis, risk modeling
- **Storytelling** – Turning financial data into clear strategic insight

## 📉 Key Insight  
> Even though EIC became profitable in 2018, the analysis showed it was too little, too late. Years of high losses and systemic issues had already undermined its ability to recover, making collapse inevitable.
