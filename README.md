Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize EIC’s 2014–2018 financials, revealing how sustained underwriting losses and delayed action led to collapse despite a 2018 profit. The analysis showed how even though the company became profitable by 2018, it was too little, and too late due to years of high losses.
